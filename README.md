# Create your own CTF challenges

This repo houses various CTF challenges.

## Instructions

### Background:
Authorities were able to make an arrest against a known hacker group in the area. They have managed to recover a few files from the hard drives.
One of the files they recovered was called `ctf.pyc`, but the authorities are not sure what is needed to view this file.

### Tasks:
The authorities have asked you to attempt to figure out the following:
* What programming language is the file written in?
* What numbering system is the flag written in BEFORE being translated?
* What is the hidden flag value?
