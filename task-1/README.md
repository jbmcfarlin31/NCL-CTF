# Instructions

## Background:
Authorities were able to make an arrest against a known hacker group in the area. They have managed to recover a few files from the hard drives.
One of the files they recovered was called `ctf.pyc`, but the authorities are not sure what is needed to view this file.

## Tasks:
The authorities have asked you to attempt to figure out the following:
### Command-line (interaction and open source intelligence gathering)
1. What is the utility used to interact with this repository?
2. Who created the utility you mentioned above?
3. What is the command using the utility above to clone this repo onto your local system?
4. If you were to make a change to this repo, what command would you use to add that change to your local system? (Hint: `commit`)
5. If you were to make a change to this repo, what command would use to push the local system changes to this repo? (Hint: `push`)

### Enumeration and Exploitation
1. What programming language is the file written in?
2. What numbering system is the flag written in _BEFORE_ being translated?
3. What is the numbering system that the flag is converted to?
4. What is the the function `chr()` doing in this case?
5. What is the hidden flag value?

### Conversions (use the human-readable version of the flag unless otherwise specified)
1. Convert the flag into hexadecimal.
2. Convert the flag into binary representation.
